  <h1>About Us</h1>

  <p>Ullman Sails is a global sailmaking super power, but we would hate to think that this is all we are.</p>
  <p>A trip to the sailmaker used to mean a trip to the sail loft, a few pleasant hours looking at fabrics and machinery. A small amount of good natured haggling and then a handshake to seal the deal. A few weeks later the new sail would be ready and a short trip out to check the sail would ensue.</p>
  <p>Many people have maligned the passing of these days as now modern technology has lead to orders being placed online. Modern fabrics, computer design and vast data banks of empirical information have decreased the need for the sailmaker to visit the yacht. It appears that the days of customer service have been replaced with the email and standardisation.</p>
